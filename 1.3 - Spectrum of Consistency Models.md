# Spectrum of Consistency Models

## What is consistency?

In distributed systems, consistency may mean many things. For example:

- that each replica node has the same view of data at a given point in time.
- that each read request gets the value of the recent write.

But there are much many more forms of consistency.

**Consistency models** provides us with abstractions to reaons about the correctness of a distributed system doing concurrent data reads, writes and mutations.

The two ends of the consistency spectrum are: **weakest consistency** and **strongest consistency**.
