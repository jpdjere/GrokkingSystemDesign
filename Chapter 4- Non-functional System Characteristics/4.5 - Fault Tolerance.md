# Fault Tolerance

## What is fault tolerance?

**Fault tolerance** refers to a system's ability to execute persistently even if one or more of its components fail. Components can be software or hardware. A system that is 100% fault-tolerant is very difficult to achive.

## Fault tolerance techniques

Failure occurs at the hardware or software level, which eventually affects the data. Fault tolerance can be achieved by many apporaches, considering the system structure. Let's discuss the techniques taht are significant and suitable for most designs:

### Replication

**Replication-based fault tolerance** is the technique of replicating both services and data: when they fail, failed nodes are swapped with healthy ones and failed data stores are swapped by their replicas.
