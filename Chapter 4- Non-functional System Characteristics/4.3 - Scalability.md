# Scalability

## What is scalability?

**Scalability** is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of workload without compromising performance.  The workload can be of different types, including the following:

- **Request workload:** The number of requests served by the system.
- **Data/storage workload:** The amount of data stored by the system.

## Different approaches of scalability

### Vertical scalability - "scaling up"

**Vertical scaling**, also known as **"scaling up"**, refers to scaling by providing additional resources or capabilities (for example, additional CPUs or RAM) to an existing device. It allows us to expand our present hardware of software capacity, but we can only grow it to the limitations of our servers. The dollar cost of vertical scaling is usually high.

### Horizontal scalability - "scaling out"

**Horizontal scalability**, also known as **"scaling out"**, refers to increasing the number of machines in the network. The dollar cost for this type of scaling is lower as in vertical scaling; but has the challenge of building out a system where the multiple nodes can work collectively as a single server.

## More on scalability

A key metric for measuring is how system performance change as load increases. Ideally, a scalable system maintains consistence performance as it grows. This is often visualized using scalability graphs, which plot system throughput against increasing load or resources.

Scalability isn't only about handling peak loads: a well-designed scalable system should also be able to scale down efficiently when demand decreases, helping to optimize resource usage and costs.

Cloud computing has significantly impacted how we approach scalability, offering flexible resources that can be adjsuted on-demand. But it also introduced new considerations areound cost management and data consistency across distribtued systems.

## Dimensions of scalability

The concept of scalability in system design encompasses several dimensions, each addressing different aspects of a system's ability to grow and adapt.

**1. Load scalability:** a system's ability to handle increased workload without significant degradation in performance. This can mean processing more transactions, serving more users, or handling larger datasets. A system with good scalability maintains its respons time and throughput as the demand increases.

**2. Geographic scalability:** a system's capacity to maintain its effectiveness while expanding across different physical locations or regions. This becomes crucial for global services which need to maintain low latency for users across the world.

**3. Administrative scalability:** how well a system can be managed as it grows larger and more complex, and how easit it remains to maintain, monitor and update as it expands. This often involves considerations like automation, clear documentation and efficient management tools.

**4. Functional scalability:** a system's ability to easily add new features or functionality without disrupting existing operations.
